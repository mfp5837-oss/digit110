        <quote source="Beatles">“It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band to
            play..."</quote>. Actually, it was <duration quantity="21.5" unit="year">21½ years ago
            today</duration> that <persName>Jon Bosak</persName> pulled together the original
            <orgname>XML Working Group</orgname>. But yes, it was <event>on <date year="1998"
                month="02" day="10">February 10, 1998</date> that <codespec>XML 1.0</codespec> was
            released to the world</event>. Which is worth talking about.</p>
    <p>It turns out that if you follow the pointers back, the original <codespec>XML 1.0Specification</codespec> is still out there &amp; <rs type="person" ref="Bray_Tim">my
            fingers</rs> were the last to touch that document. The history of how XML came to be has
        been told at great length elsewhere, as have the details about <date year="1998" month="02" day="10">that February 10th</date>, so there’s no need to revisit.</p>
    <p>
        <event year="2018" month="02" day="10">Happy birthday!</event>
