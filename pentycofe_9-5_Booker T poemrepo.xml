<character main="1">Booker T.</character>
<line num="1">Was a practical man.</line>
<line num="2">He said, Till the soil</line>
<line num="3">And learn from the land.</line>
<line num="4">Let down your bucket</line> <!-- In orginal document lines 9 through 14 contain a red stamp that's under the text -->
<line num="5">Where you are.</line>  
<line num="6">Your fate is here</line>
<line num="7">And not afar.</line>
<line num="8">To help yourself</line>
<line num="9">And your fellow man,</line>
<line num="10">Train your head,</line> <!-- Lines 9 an 10 and 15 an 16 come from Washinhton's exposition speech from 1895 in Atlanta  -->
<line num="11">Your heart, and your hand.</line>
<line num="12">For smartness alone's</line>
<line num="13">Surely not meet—</line>
<line num="14">If you haven't at the same time</line>
<line num="15">Got something to eat.</line>
<line num="16">Thus at Tuskegee</line>
<line num="17">He built a school</line>
<line num="18">With book-learning there</line>
<line num="19">And the workman's tool.</line>
<line num="20">He started out</line>
<line num="21">In a simple way—</line>
<line num="22">For yesterday</line> <!--Lines 27 and 28 talks about how the talk of compromise in Washington's day was possibly thw only safe way for equal rights  -->
<line num="23">Was not today.</line>
<line num="24">Sometimes he had</line>
<line num="25">Compromise in his talk—</line><!-- Lines 30,31, and 32 state that in order for black people to progress in the South they needed to build a foundation to then build upon from there -->
<line num="26">For a man must crawl</line>
<line num="27">Before he can walk—</line>
<line num="28">And in Alabama in '85</line>
<line num="29">A joker was lucky</line>
<line num="30">To be alive.</line>
<line num="31">But Booker T.</line>
<line num="32">Was nobody's fool:</line>
<line num="33">You may carve a dream</line>
<line num="34">With an humble tool.</line>
<line num="35">The tallest tower</line>
<line num="36">Can tumble down</line>
<line num="37">If it be not rooted</line>
<line num="38">In solid ground.</line>
<line num="39">So, being a far-seeing</line></frontpage>

<line num="40">Practical man,</line> <!-- By refering to Booker T as a practical man he thinks that Booker T was realistic and sensible so he sees him as a clever man -->
<line num="41">He said, Train your head,</line>
<line num="42">Your heart, and your hand.</line>
<line num="43">Your fate is here</line>
<line num="44">And not afar,</line>
<line num="45">So let down your bucket</line>
<line num="46">Where you are.</line><br /> <!-- Lines 49 through 54 Washington uses this line again establishing how important it is for everyone to stop what they're doing and to look at what's right in front of them he also states that people should enlighten themselves on the issues and barriers that are woven into society and then working together to make a change -->
